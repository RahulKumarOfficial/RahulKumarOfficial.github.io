title: An overview of Traditional Machine Learning
---

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. While deep learning has become popular, traditional machine learning techniques are still **highly relevant** due to their simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, especially when working with smaller datasets. This post provides an overview of the fundamental concepts in traditional machine learning.

In this post, we will go through the main types of traditional machine learning and talk about them in brief:

## 1. **Supervised Learning**
In supervised learning, the model learns from a labeled dataset, which **contains input-output pairs**. The goal is to predict the output for new inputs based on the learned relationships.

### Types of Supervised Learning:
Supervised Learning is sub-categorized as two differeent categories, namely:
- **Classification**: Predicts a categorical label (e.g. spam or not spam)
- **Regression**: Predicts a continuous value (e.g. house prices)
