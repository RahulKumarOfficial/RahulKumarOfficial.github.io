title: An overview of Traditional Machine Learning
---

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. While deep learning has become popular, traditional machine learning techniques are still highly relevant due to their simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency, especially when working with smaller datasets. This post provides an overview of the fundamental concepts in traditional machine learning.

## 1. **Supervised Learning**
In supervised learning, the model learns from a labeled dataset, which contains input-output pairs. The goal is to predict the output for new inputs based on the learned relationships.

### Types of Supervised Learning:
- **Classification**: Predicts a categorical label (e.g., spam or not spam). Examples include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- **Regression**: Predicts a continuous value (e.g., house prices). Examples include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

## 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The goal is to infer the natural structure present in a dataset.

### Types of Unsupervised Learning:
- **Clustering**: Groups data points based on similarity (e.g., k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN).
- **Association**: Discovers rules that describe large portions of the dataset (e.g., Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of input features (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)).

## 3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
Semi-supervised learning falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data for training. This is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

## 4. **Reinforcement Learning**
Reinforcement learning is an area where an agent learns to make decisions by performing certain actions and receiving rewards or penalties. It's commonly used in robotics, gaming, and real-time decision-making.

## 5. **Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating features (input variables) to improve the performance of a model. Techniques include:
- **Scaling**: Standardization or normalization of features.
- **Encoding**: Transforming categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing feature space to prevent overfitting (e.g., PCA).

## 6. **Model Evaluation**
Model evaluation is crucial to assess a model's performance. Common metrics include:
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
- **Regression**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

Cross-validation is often used to ensure that the model's performance generalizes well to unseen data.

## 7. **Model Selection**
Choosing the right model depends on the problem, dataset size, and computational resources. Popular algorithms include:
- **Linear Models**: Simple and interpretable (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression).
- **Tree-based Models**: Capture non-linear relationships (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Support Vector Machines**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, suitable for text classification.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A simple, instance-based learning method.

## 8. **Overfitting and Underfitting**
- **Overfitting**: The model learns noise and details from the training data, performing well on training data but poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting**: The model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test data.

**Regularization** techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) are commonly used to prevent overfitting.

## 9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
Hyperparameters are external parameters set before training (e.g., learning rate, number of trees in a Random Forest). Techniques for tuning include:
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
- **Random Search**: Randomly samples from a range of parameter values.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probability models to select the most promising hyperparameters.

## 10. **Model Deployment**
Once a model is trained and evaluated, it needs to be deployed to a production environment for real-world use. This step involves:
- **Model Serialization**: Saving the model (e.g., using Pickle in Python).
- **APIs**: Exposing the model as a REST API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).
- **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance over time to identify the need for retraining.

## Conclusion
Traditional machine learning offers a suite of powerful, interpretable, and computationally efficient algorithms. It is an essential part of the data scientist's toolkit, especially when working with structured data and smaller datasets. While deep learning excels in complex tasks like image and language processing, traditional ML remains the go-to choice for many real-world applications.

By understanding the fundamentals of traditional machine learning, practitioners can effectively choose and apply the right algorithms for their specific problems.
