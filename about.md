Hey there,

I'm Rahul, a passionate software engineer dedicated to staying current with the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning. I am currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** and I am expanding my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field while actively sharing insights and offering support to help others on their learning journey.

## Why IntuitifAI
I have started this project to share my knowledge and information in the most intuitive way. I will try my best to not make things complex and deliver the concepts in Machine Learning, LLMs as well as Stoicism. Also this project helps me to learn and grow as a person.
